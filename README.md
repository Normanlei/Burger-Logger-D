# Burger-Logger-D

## Description

MVC is an architectural pattern that structures our codebase in three distinct sections according to a software design philosophy, which is known as "Model, View and Controller". It is a very common design patter for most of full-stack project. In this project, I am creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM pattern as a full-stack application, which can record, manipulate, delete all the burger logging data.

Here is how the application made of:
* UI: **Handlebars**
* Database: **MySQL** & **ORM**
* Backend: **Node**, **Express** and **Sequelize**


### Demo
Heroku Depolyment: [GO](https://burgerloggerdelete.herokuapp.com/)

## Development

In the process of building application, I have learned:
* Utilize Github repository, familiarize git commands to save all my works onto github

* Familiarize the basic html commands to build the full contents of the site

* Approaching MVC design pattern with a homeamde ORM, especially with two tables interactions.

* Familiarile using handelbars which turned out more efficient on manipulating the database data.

* Familiarlize the differeces between using ORM pattern and sequelize CLI [check](https://github.com/Normanlei/Burger-Logger-Sequelize)

### Future Development

* Using sequelize CLI to approach

* Rendering HTML instead of handlebars to see the differences
